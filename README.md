# Causal Dynamic Network Modeling
CDN is a python-based package implementing causal dynamic network analysis for Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It aims to improve the dynamic causal modelling with optimization based method. Our optimization-based  method and algorithm compute efficiently the ODE parameters from fMRI data, instead of comparing potentially a huge  number of candidate ODE models. For a detailed introduction of dynamic causal modeling and our proposed method, See [(1)] and [(2)]. 



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
